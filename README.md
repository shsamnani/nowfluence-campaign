# nowfluence-campaign
A basic one page application to showcase tailwind and UI designing skills

## How to run?
- Simply clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/shsamnani/nowfluence-campaign.git"` or download as zip and extract the zip file
- Run `index.html`

## What's here to showcase?
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Bonus - Supports dark-theme

## Limitations
- Because of image provided as specification instead of Figma
    - Not pixel perfect   
    - The fonts, icons wouldn't fully match

## Why using HTML and plain JavaScript?
- Using React or Next.js would be an overkill for such a simple task. Let me know if you want to wrap it in any of these as that is your tech-stack
